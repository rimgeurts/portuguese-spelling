Issues:
- Remove empty spaces before submitting a Question and Answer
- Add sound when question is submitted
- Prevent blank questions and answers being added to the quiz
- During a test/quiz and clicking refresh page (F5) the quiz will break. It should redirect to the quizlist
- If holding the enter key during a test the score will display -200%
- When a quiz is exited before the end, an option to continue the quiz should appear in the quizlist
- In the quiz viewer, make the close button easier to see
- In the quizviewer, after the answer has been submitted it is still possible to add special characters (they should be disabled)
- In the quizviewer a long word exceeds the limit of the input div
- Option to add hint text to question
- Automatically submit when clicking outside question / answer / title inputs
- In the quizviewer and a user forgets to enter an accent, it should be counted as correct BUT a warning message should appear.
- If you access a quiz via a direct URL i.e. http://localhost:3000/quiz/66, it does not work correct. No results are created in the database
- In strapi setup bootstrap data to create the 'Everyone' and 'Administrators' groups when the application starts
- In strapi, in the 'UserGroup' controller, prevent users from creating groups with reserved names like: 'Everyone' and 'Administrators'
- In strapi, after a new user is created a new group will need to be created for that user. The user will also need to be listed as the group owner.



Ideas:
-   Create different difficulty levels that already display part of the word
-   Create a space for language teachers that allows them to create a group and assign homework to each of their students.
    The teacher has the ability to see the quiz results of the students.
    Only the teachers will have to pay a small monthly subsbription. The students are free.
    Teacher will also be able to set their quizzes as private.
-   Students that pay a small fee (i.e. 10 USD per year) get the following benifits:
        o No Advertisements
        o Review mistakes after completing quiz (a new quiz with only the mistakes is generated)
        o Option to play an AI generated audio clip of the word
        o Pick different difficulty levels
        o Progress Tracking / Achievements
