Issues:
- Remove empty spaces before submitting a Question and Answer
- Make it quicker / easier to insert a new Question
- Add options to ignore special characters like question marks but also language specific letters
- Add sound when question is submitted
- Prevent blank questions and answers being added to the quiz

Ideas:
-   Create a space for language teachers that allows them to create a group and assign homework to each of their students.
    The teacher has the ability to see the quiz results of the students.
    Only the teachers will have to pay a small monthly subsbription. The students are free.
    Teacher will also be able to set their quizzes as private.
-   Students that pay a small fee (i.e. 10 USD per year) get the following benifits:
        o No Advertisements
        o Review mistakes after completing quiz
        o Option to play an AI generated audio clip of the word
        o Progress Tracking / Achievements
